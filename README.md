# pmos-xiaomi-daisy
Efforts in running PostMarketOS (https://postmarketos.org/) on Xiaomi's "Daisy" device (Mi A2 Lite).

All of the credit for the kernel bases go to xiaomi (xiaomi-daisy) and Aarqw12 (xiaomi-daisy-2).

# How to help: 
1) Unlock your Mi A2 Lite's bootloader
2) Clone repo and install pmbootstrap (https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide)
3) Move your selected kernel variant's folder to your aports/pmaports folder (https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device)
4) Try editing some params the config, adding patches etc.
5) Build linux-xiaomi-daisy(-2), see if build is successful, do the same for device-xiaomi-daisy(-2), if you feel ok with deleting any previous chroots then run 'pmbootstrap zap'.
6) Run 'pmbootstrap install' and then use 'pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs' with device connected in fastboot mode. After the system image flash is successful, run 'pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel' to flash the necessary files to boot pmos.
7) Check if you got stuff to work, the main focus right now is on getting the framebuffer to work and fixing ssh errors.
8) If you get any improvements, feel free to make a pull request and include all necessary files for linux and device building.
